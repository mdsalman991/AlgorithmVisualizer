A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 

Web App: https://mdsalman991.github.io/AlgorithmVisualizer

So far there are 6 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game

I have implemented a total of `14 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.  

## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- Recursive Maze Creation
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Binary Search
